Initial thoughts and assumptions:

> Due to the fact that I knew [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) already in advance of this lab
> I felt well-prepared. During my internship I already solved this up to level 4 in the Main Area. I also used GitHub
> already quite a bit, so I felt positive for the untouched remote part as well.

Describe the process of solving the tasks:

> My approach for solving the puzzles I always start with pen and paper and take notes about the tutorial steps and the
> hints from the start screens. This was done for almost every level. This helped my to memorize the commands and to
> remember the tasks. Something I want to mention is that I was sometimes a bit confused what I actually should do to 
> reach the shown goal, so I had to reset some puzzles several times. Overall, I would assume that the pure solution 
> time for me was 4 hours divided into several sessions (including during the internship).
> There were two puzzles which I was not able to solve on my own because I had no clue how to reach the goal and used
> a solution. I also used the solution for the 3 advanced puzzles but as they were not required I will not go deeper into
> that here.  
>
> For Remote 1-8 I was not able to figure out how to move main one level back up again to match the given goal.

> 
> During Main 4-2 I was totally confused how to reach the shown goal because I was first not able to read the branch-names
> in the middle of the goal part and second how to create the C2``` and C3`` commits. I tried around quite some time
> with omitting commits during the rebase -i usage before I realized that I should try to reorder them.
> The inbuilt solution was not helping with this issue as it just called the GUI but gave no hint about the correct order.

Describe the final outcome:

> I learned alot about git and how important it is to get used to it. I am still not feeling comfortable with advanced 
> commands and complex move / reset - rebase combinations, but my knowledge about git basics has become much more deep.

Extra: *What other option could be useful to enable? Please document your findings in the assigment documentation.*
> During our lab session we already enabled other options.
> - Restrict deletions - Only allow users with bypass permissions to delete matching refs
> - Block force pushes - Prevent users with push access from force pushing to refs
